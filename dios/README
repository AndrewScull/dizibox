DiziBox is a port/hack of BusyBox onto DIOS. DiziBox itself runs as a legacy
application using legacy syscalls but is capable of launching DIOS tasks where
appropriate.

The way this is achieved at the moemnt is by hijacking the exec() family of
functions and implementing them in a way that is DIOS friendly. This can be seen
in dios/exec.c

make dios_defconfig
make menuconfig
# select BusyBox Settings
#  then Build Options
#   then Additional CFLAGS
#    add include path for <shared/*> headers
